@article{Pettersen2006,
abstract = {A new method for estimation of current-source density (CSD) from local field potentials is presented. This inverse CSD (iCSD) method is based on explicit inversion of the electrostatic forward solution and can be applied to data from multielectrode arrays with various geometries. Here, the method is applied to linear-array (laminar) electrode data. Three iCSD methods are considered: the CSD is assumed to have cylindrical symmetry and be (i) localized in infinitely thin discs, (ii) step-wise constant or (iii) continuous and smoothly varying (using cubic splines) in the vertical direction. For spatially confined CSD distributions the standard CSD method, involving a discrete double derivative, is seen in model calculations to give significant estimation errors when the lateral source dimension is comparable to the size of a cortical column (less than approximately 1 mm). Further, discontinuities in the extracellular conductivity are seen to potentially give sizable errors for even wider source distributions. The iCSD methods are seen to give excellent estimates when the correct lateral source dimension and spatial distribution of conductivity are incorporated. To illustrate the application to real data, iCSD estimates of stimulus-evoked responses measured with laminar electrodes in the rat somatosensory (barrel) cortex are compared to estimates from the standard CSD method.},

@article{Winder2007,
abstract = {Although progress has been made in relating neuronal events to changes in brain metabolism and blood flow, the interpretation of functional neuroimaging data in terms of the underlying brain circuits is still poorly understood. Computational modeling of connection patterns both among and within regions can be helpful in this interpretation. We present a neural network model of the ventral visual pathway and its relevant functional connections. This includes a new learning method that adjusts the magnitude of interregional connections in order to match experimental results of an arbitrary functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data set. We demonstrate that this method finds the appropriate connection strengths when trained on a model system with known, randomly chosen connection weights. We then use the method for examining fMRI results from a one-back matching task in human subjects, both healthy and those with schizophrenia. The results discovered by the learning method support previous findings of a disconnection between left temporal and frontal cortices in the group with schizophrenia and a concomitant increase of right-sided temporo-frontal connection strengths. We then demonstrate that the disconnection may be explained by reduced local recurrent circuitry in frontal cortex. This method extends currently available methods for estimating functional connectivity from human imaging data by including both local circuits and features of interregional connections, such as topography and sparseness, in addition to total connection strengths. Furthermore, our results suggest how fronto-temporal functional disconnection in schizophrenia can result from reduced local synaptic connections within frontal cortex rather than compromised interregional connections.},

@article{Johnston2007,
abstract = {Signal variations in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging experiments essentially reflect the vascular system response to increased demand for oxygen caused by neuronal activity, termed the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) effect. The most comprehensive model to date of the BOLD signal is formulated as a mixed continuous-discrete-time system of nonlinear stochastic differential equations. Previous approaches to the analysis of this system have been based on linearised approximations of the dynamics, which are limited in their ability to capture the inherent nonlinearities in the physiological system. In this paper we present a nonlinear filtering method for simultaneous estimation of the hidden physiological states and the system parameters, based on an iterative coordinate descent framework. State estimates of the cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume and deoxyhaemoglobin content are determined using a particle filter, demonstrated via simulation to be accurate, robust and efficient in comparison to linearisation-based techniques. The adaptive state and parameter estimation algorithm generates physiologically reasonable parameter estimates for experimental fMRI data. It is anticipated that signal processing techniques for modelling and estimation will become increasingly important in fMRI analyses as limitations of linear and linearised modelling are reached.},

@article{Liu1998,
abstract = {The goal of our research is to develop an experimental and analytical framework for spatiotemporal imaging of human brain function. Preliminary studies suggest that noninvasive spatiotemporal maps of cerebral activity can be produced by combining the high spatial resolution (millimeters) of functional MRI (fMRI) with the high temporal resolution (milliseconds) of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Although MEG and EEG are sensitive to millisecond changes in mental activity, the ability to resolve source localization and timing is limited by the ill-posed "inverse" problem. We conducted Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the use of MRI constraints in a linear estimation inverse procedure, where fMRI weighting, cortical location and orientation, and sensor noise statistics were realistically incorporated. An error metric was computed to quantify the effects of fMRI invisible ("missing") sources, "extra" fMRI sources, and cortical orientation errors. Our simulation results demonstrate that prior anatomical and functional information from MRI can be used to regularize the EEG/MEG inverse problem, giving an improved solution with high spatial and temporal resolution. An fMRI weighting of approximately 90\% was determined to provide the best compromise between separation of activity from correctly localized sources and minimization of error caused by missing sources. The accuracy of the estimate was relatively independent of the number and extent of the sources, allowing for incorporation of physiologically realistic multiple distributed sources. This linear estimation method provides an operator-independent approach for combining information from fMRI, MEG, and EEG and represents a significant advance over traditional dipole modeling.},

abstract = {In our daily life we look at many scenes. Some are rapidly forgotten, but others we recognize later. We accurately predicted recognition success with natural scene photographs using single trial magnetoencephalography (MEG) measures of brain activation. Specifically, we demonstrate that MEG responses in the initial 600 ms following the onset of scene photographs allow for prediction accuracy rates up to 84.1\% using linear Support-Vector-Machine classification (lSVM). A permutation test confirmed that all lSVM based prediction rates were significantly better than "guessing". More generally, we present four approaches to analyzing brain function using lSVMs. (1) We show that lSVMs can be used to extract spatio-temporal patterns of brain activation from MEG-data. (2) We show lSVM classification can demonstrate significant correlations between comparatively early and late processes predictive of scene recognition, indicating dependencies between these processes over time. (3) We use lSVM classification to compare the information content of oscillatory and event-related MEG-activations and show they contain a similar amount of and largely overlapping information. (4) A more detailed analysis of single-trial predictiveness of different frequency bands revealed that theta band activity around 5 Hz allowed for highest prediction rates, and these rates are indistinguishable from those obtained with a full dataset. In sum our results clearly demonstrate that lSVMs can reliably predict natural scene recognition from single trial MEG-activation measures and can be a useful tool for analyzing predictive brain function.},

abstract = {The interpretation of the blood-oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) post-stimulus undershoot has been a topic of considerable interest, as the mechanisms behind this prominent BOLD transient may provide valuable clues on the neurovascular response process and energy supply routes of the brain. Biomechanical theories explain the origin of the BOLD undershoot through the passive ballooning of post-capillary vessels which leads to an increase in venous blood volume (CBV(v), comprising deoxygenated blood in capillary, venular and arteriolar compartments), resulting in susceptibility-induced signal decrease. While there has been substantial evidence supporting a role for venous ballooning, there have also been reports arguing for a prolonged post-stimulus elevation in cerebral oxygenation consumption (CMRo(2)) as the primary cause. Furthermore, a contribution of post-stimulus cerebral blood flow (CBF) undershoots has also been demonstrated. To clarify the role of the venous compartment in causing the BOLD undershoot, we performed in vivo fMRI measurements of the transient DeltaCBV(v), DeltaCBF and DeltaBOLD responses in healthy humans. We observed a slow post-stimulus return to baseline in venous CBV which supports the existence of a passive "balloon" effect, implying that previous observations of a quicker recovery of the total CBV response may be dominated by arterial CBV change. Our findings also support a significant contribution from the CBF undershoots, which, combined with a slow venous CBV response, would account for much of the BOLD undershoot.},

abstract = {Unknown low frequency fluctuations called "trend" are observed in noisy time-series measured for different applications. In some disciplines, they carry primary information while in other fields such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) they carry nuisance effects. In all cases, however, it is necessary to estimate them accurately. In this paper, a method for estimating trend in the presence of fractal noise is proposed and applied to fMRI time-series. To this end, a partly linear model (PLM) is fitted to each time-series. The parametric and nonparametric parts of PLM are considered as contributions of hemodynamic response and trend, respectively. Using the whitening property of wavelet transform, the unknown components of the model are estimated in the wavelet domain. The results of the proposed method are compared to those of other parametric trend-removal approaches such as spline and polynomial models. It is shown that the proposed method improves activation detection and decreases variance of the estimated parameters relative to the other methods.},

Findings from the three investigations reported here indicate that scientific results that confirm a danger (negative results) do affect confidence in a study's validity and resulting risk assessments differently than results indicating low risk (positive results). Findings of Study 1 revealed that research results indicating a health risk were more trusted than results indicating little health risk. This effect was independent of the credibility of the information source. Study 2 demonstrated that confidence in research results increased with an increasing indication of health risk. Study 3 showed that people have more confidence in the results of animal tests on a food additive indicating negative human health effects than in animal tests indicating that a food additive is harmless. The findings have important practical implications. The observed asymmetry between positive and negative research results may be one reason that people are afraid of many of the hazards they are faced with in modern society.},

abstract = {This paper reviews hierarchical observation models, used in functional neuroimaging, in a Bayesian light. It emphasizes the common ground shared by classical and Bayesian methods to show that conventional analyses of neuroimaging data can be usefully extended within an empirical Bayesian framework. In particular we formulate the procedures used in conventional data analysis in terms of hierarchical linear models and establish a connection between classical inference and parametric empirical Bayes (PEB) through covariance component estimation. This estimation is based on an expectation maximization or EM algorithm. The key point is that hierarchical models not only provide for appropriate inference at the highest level but that one can revisit lower levels suitably equipped to make Bayesian inferences. Bayesian inferences eschew many of the difficulties encountered with classical inference and characterize brain responses in a way that is more directly predicated on what one is interested in. The motivation for Bayesian approaches is reviewed and the theoretical background is presented in a way that relates to conventional methods, in particular restricted maximum likelihood (ReML). This paper is a technical and theoretical prelude to subsequent papers that deal with applications of the theory to a range of important issues in neuroimaging. These issues include; (i) Estimating nonsphericity or variance components in fMRI time-series that can arise from serial correlations within subject, or are induced by multisubject (i.e., hierarchical) studies. (ii) Spatiotemporal Bayesian models for imaging data, in which voxels-specific effects are constrained by responses in other voxels. (iii) Bayesian estimation of nonlinear models of hemodynamic responses and (iv) principled ways of mixing structural and functional priors in EEG source reconstruction. Although diverse, all these estimation problems are accommodated by the PEB framework described in this paper.},

@article{Kay2008,
abstract = {A challenging goal in neuroscience is to be able to read out, or decode, mental content from brain activity. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have decoded orientation, position and object category from activity in visual cortex. However, these studies typically used relatively simple stimuli (for example, gratings) or images drawn from fixed categories (for example, faces, houses), and decoding was based on previous measurements of brain activity evoked by those same stimuli or categories. To overcome these limitations, here we develop a decoding method based on quantitative receptive-field models that characterize the relationship between visual stimuli and fMRI activity in early visual areas. These models describe the tuning of individual voxels for space, orientation and spatial frequency, and are estimated directly from responses evoked by natural images. We show that these receptive-field models make it possible to identify, from a large set of completely novel natural images, which specific image was seen by an observer. Identification is not a mere consequence of the retinotopic organization of visual areas; simpler receptive-field models that describe only spatial tuning yield much poorer identification performance. Our results suggest that it may soon be possible to reconstruct a picture of a person's visual experience from measurements of brain activity alone.},

abstract = {This paper presents a variational treatment of dynamic models that furnishes time-dependent conditional densities on the path or trajectory of a system's states and the time-independent densities of its parameters. These are obtained by maximising a variational action with respect to conditional densities, under a fixed-form assumption about their form. The action or path-integral of free-energy represents a lower bound on the model's log-evidence or marginal likelihood required for model selection and averaging. This approach rests on formulating the optimisation dynamically, in generalised coordinates of motion. The resulting scheme can be used for online Bayesian inversion of nonlinear dynamic causal models and is shown to outperform existing approaches, such as Kalman and particle filtering. Furthermore, it provides for dual and triple inferences on a system's states, parameters and hyperparameters using exactly the same principles. We refer to this approach as dynamic expectation maximisation (DEM).},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a set of techniques for the evaluation of brain tissue classifiers on a large data set of MR images of the head. Due to the difficulty of establishing a gold standard for this type of data, we focus our attention on methods which do not require a ground truth, but instead rely on a common agreement principle. Three different techniques are presented: the Williams' index, a measure of common agreement; STAPLE, an Expectation Maximization algorithm which simultaneously estimates performance parameters and constructs an estimated reference standard; and Multidimensional Scaling, a visualization technique to explore similarity data. We apply these different evaluation methodologies to a set of eleven different segmentation algorithms on forty MR images. We then validate our evaluation pipeline by building a ground truth based on human expert tracings. The evaluations with and without a ground truth are compared. Our findings show that comparing classifiers without a gold standard can provide a lot of interesting information. In particular, outliers can be easily detected, strongly consistent or highly variable techniques can be readily discriminated, and the overall similarity between different techniques can be assessed. On the other hand, we also find that some information present in the expert segmentations is not captured by the automatic classifiers, suggesting that common agreement alone may not be sufficient for a precise performance evaluation of brain tissue classifiers.},

abstract = {A new method is presented for extraction of population firing-rate models for both thalamocortical and intracortical signal transfer based on stimulus-evoked data from simultaneous thalamic single-electrode and cortical recordings using linear (laminar) multielectrodes in the rat barrel system. Time-dependent population firing rates for granular (layer 4), supragranular (layer 2/3), and infragranular (layer 5) populations in a barrel column and the thalamic population in the homologous barreloid are extracted from the high-frequency portion (multi-unit activity; MUA) of the recorded extracellular signals. These extracted firing rates are in turn used to identify population firing-rate models formulated as integral equations with exponentially decaying coupling kernels, allowing for straightforward transformation to the more common firing-rate formulation in terms of differential equations. Optimal model structures and model parameters are identified by minimizing the deviation between model firing rates and the experimentally extracted population firing rates. For the thalamocortical transfer, the experimental data favor a model with fast feedforward excitation from thalamus to the layer-4 laminar population combined with a slower inhibitory process due to feedforward and/or recurrent connections and mixed linear-parabolic activation functions. The extracted firing rates of the various cortical laminar populations are found to exhibit strong temporal correlations for the present experimental paradigm, and simple feedforward population firing-rate models combined with linear or mixed linear-parabolic activation function are found to provide excellent fits to the data. The identified thalamocortical and intracortical network models are thus found to be qualitatively very different. While the thalamocortical circuit is optimally stimulated by rapid changes in the thalamic firing rate, the intracortical circuits are low-pass and respond most strongly to slowly varying inputs from the cortical layer-4 population.},

abstract = {Analysis of fMRI time-series data is usually performed within the general linear model (GLM), and conclusions are based on the probability (p) of a false-positive voxel. In its simplest form, this process assumes that temporal noise in the time-series is random (white); if it is not, then an error in the estimation of p will occur. Various methods for correcting the problem have been developed, but they are not always used. Analysis packages vary in their ability to deal with this problem, and there is a lack of consistent advice to non-experts concerning whether this issue is serious or is small enough to be ignored. The variability of expert opinion partly reflects the fact that the magnitude of the error that occurs when estimating p in fMRI data is largely undocumented. In this discussion, aimed more at "neuroscience users" than methods experts, we try to clarify the position by documenting the scale of the error in a simple block-design experiment. Based on a fixed-effects group analysis of null datasets (8 participants scanned while at rest), we show that the magnitude of the problem can be very substantial. Without correction, it was necessary to set a nominal probability threshold of about p=0.000001 in order to achieve an actual probability of a false positive of 0.001. This means that if task-related activations were present in such a dataset, only if they reached the former, very low nominal p value could they be relied upon. With the use of standard correction methods, the error was largely removed. Our results suggest that some form of pre-whitening or correction for effects of non-white noise is essential in single-subject GLM analyses and fixed-effects group analyses of fMRI data. It is less important but probably prudent to apply a correction at the first level of random-effects group analyses. We also evaluate the effect of high-pass filtering. We find that the number of false positives in a fixed-effects analysis increases markedly as the filter cut-off frequency is increased. The sensitivity benefits derived from high-pass filtering may thus be partially offset by a significant increase in the number of false positives.},

abstract = {Models of effective connectivity characterize the influence that neuronal populations exert over each other. Additionally, some approaches, for example Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) and variants of Structural Equation Modelling, describe how effective connectivity is modulated by experimental manipulations. Mathematically, both are based on bilinear equations, where the bilinear term models the effect of experimental manipulations on neuronal interactions. The bilinear framework, however, precludes an important aspect of neuronal interactions that has been established with invasive electrophysiological recording studies; i.e., how the connection between two neuronal units is enabled or gated by activity in other units. These gating processes are critical for controlling the gain of neuronal populations and are mediated through interactions between synaptic inputs (e.g. by means of voltage-sensitive ion channels). They represent a key mechanism for various neurobiological processes, including top-down (e.g. attentional) modulation, learning and neuromodulation. This paper presents a nonlinear extension of DCM that models such processes (to second order) at the neuronal population level. In this way, the modulation of network interactions can be assigned to an explicit neuronal population. We present simulations and empirical results that demonstrate the validity and usefulness of this model. Analyses of synthetic data showed that nonlinear and bilinear mechanisms can be distinguished by our extended DCM. When applying the model to empirical fMRI data from a blocked attention to motion paradigm, we found that attention-induced increases in V5 responses could be best explained as a gating of the V1-->V5 connection by activity in posterior parietal cortex. Furthermore, we analysed fMRI data from an event-related binocular rivalry paradigm and found that interactions amongst percept-selective visual areas were modulated by activity in the middle frontal gyrus. In both practical examples, Bayesian model selection favoured the nonlinear models over corresponding bilinear ones.},

abstract = {We present a new method, laminar population analysis (LPA), for analysis of laminar-electrode (linear multielectrode) data, where physiological constraints are explicitly incorporated in the mathematical model: the high-frequency band [multiunit activity (MUA)] is modeled as a sum over contributions from firing activity of multiple cortical populations, whereas the low-frequency band [local field potential (LFP)] is assumed to reflect the dendritic currents caused by synaptic inputs evoked by this firing. The method is applied to stimulus-averaged laminar-electrode data from barrel cortex of anesthetized rat after single whisker flicks. Two sample data sets, distinguished by stimulus paradigm, type of applied anesthesia, and electrical boundary conditions, are studied in detail. These data sets are well accounted for by a model with four cortical populations: one supragranular, one granular, and two infragranular populations. Population current source densities (CSDs; the CSD signatures after firing in a particular population) provided by LPA are further used to estimate the synaptic connection pattern between the various populations using a new LFP template-fitting technique, where LFP population templates are found by the electrostatic forward solution based on results from compartmental modeling of morphologically reconstructed neurons. Our analysis confirms previous experimental findings regarding the synaptic connections from neurons in the granular layer onto neurons in the supragranular layers and provides predictions about other synaptic connections. Furthermore, the time dependence of the stimulus-evoked population firing activity is predicted, and the temporal ordering of response onset is found to be compatible with earlier findings.},

abstract = {In this work we present a new support vector machine (SVM)-based method for fMRI data analysis. SVM has been shown to be a powerful, efficient data-driven tool in pattern recognition, and has been applied to the supervised classification of brain cognitive states in fMRI experiments. We examine the unsupervised mapping of activated brain regions using SVM. Specifically, the mapping process is formulated as an outlier detection problem of one-class SVM (OCSVM) that provides initial mapping results. These results are further refined by applying prototype selection and SVM reclassification. Multiple spatial and temporal features are extracted and selected to facilitate SVM learning. The proposed method was compared with correlation analysis (CA), t-test (TT), and spatial independent component analysis (SICA) methods using synthetic and experimental data. Our results show that the proposed method can provide more accurate and robust activation mapping than CA, TT and SICA, and is computationally more efficient than SICA. Besides its applicability to typical fMRI experiments, the proposed method is also a powerful tool in fMRI studies where a reliable quantification of activated brain regions is required.},

abstract = {Information transfer plays a central role in the biology of most organisms, particularly social species [1, 2]. Although the neurophysiological processes by which signals are produced, conducted, perceived, and interpreted are well understood, the conditions conducive to the evolution of communication and the paths by which reliable systems of communication become established remain largely unknown. This is a particularly challenging problem because efficient communication requires tight coevolution between the signal emitted and the response elicited [3]. We conducted repeated trials of experimental evolution with robots that could produce visual signals to provide information on food location. We found that communication readily evolves when colonies consist of genetically similar individuals and when selection acts at the colony level. We identified several distinct communication systems that differed in their efficiency. Once a given system of communication was well established, it constrained the evolution of more efficient communication systems. Under individual selection, the ability to produce visual signals resulted in the evolution of deceptive communication strategies in colonies of unrelated robots and a concomitant decrease in colony performance. This study generates predictions about the evolutionary conditions conducive to the emergence of communication and provides guidelines for designing artificial evolutionary systems displaying spontaneous communication.},

In this paradigm, the averaged ERPs exhibit an N400 followed by a sentence final negativity. Contemporary sentence processing models predict a late positivity (P600) as well.

abstract = {Exposures to extremely low-frequency electric and magnetic fields (EMF) emanating from the generation, transmission, and use of electricity are a ubiquitous part of modern life. Concern about potential adverse health effects was initially brought to prominence by an epidemiologic report two decades ago from Denver on childhood cancer. We reviewed the now voluminous epidemiologic literature on EMF and risks of chronic disease and conclude the following: a) The quality of epidemiologic studies on this topic has improved over time and several of the recent studies on childhood leukemia and on cancer associated with occupational exposure are close to the limit of what can realistically be achieved in terms of size of study and methodological rigor. b) Exposure assessment is a particular difficulty of EMF epidemiology, in several respects: i) The exposure is imperceptible, ubiquitous, has multiple sources, and can vary greatly over time and short distances. ii) The exposure period of relevance is before the date at which measurements can realistically be obtained and of unknown duration and induction period. iii) The appropriate exposure metric is not known and there are no biological data from which to impute it. c) In the absence of experimental evidence and given the methodological uncertainties in the epidemiologic literature, there is no chronic disease for which an etiological relation to EMF can be regarded as established. d) There has been a large body of high quality data for childhood cancer, and also for adult leukemia and brain tumor in relation to occupational exposure. Among all the outcomes evaluated in epidemiologic studies of EMF, childhood leukemia in relation to postnatal exposures above 0.4 microT is the one for which there is most evidence of an association. The relative risk has been estimated at 2.0 (95\% confidence limit: 1.27-3.13) in a large pooled analysis. This is unlikely to be due to chance but, may be, in part, due to bias. This is difficult to interpret in the absence of a known mechanism or reproducible experimental support. In the large pooled analysis only 0.8\% of all children were exposed above 0.4 microT. Further studies need to be designed to test specific hypotheses such as aspects of selection bias or exposure. On the basis of epidemiologic findings, evidence shows an association of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with occupational EMF exposure although confounding is a potential explanation. Breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and suicide and depression remain unresolved.},

abstract = {The measurement of the T2 relaxation time (T2 relaxometry) had been established as a reliable tool for the assessment of certain conditions such as temporal lobe epilepsy. The standard procedure for analysis of T2 data uses manually drawn regions of interest (ROIs). This approach is limited by its subjective nature and its restricted scope of investigation within selected regions of the brain. In this study, we introduce a voxel-based analysis approach termed voxel-based relaxometry (VBR). Tissue signal changes were assessed in 19 patients with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) and in 38 healthy controls using (i) conventional ROI-based analysis with several bilateral ROIs and also (ii) the VBR method in which the T2 maps are warped to a stereotactic space, smoothed and statistically compared. Conventional ROI analysis identified the expected T2 increase in the sclerotic hippocampus in all HS patients. Furthermore, 13 of the 19 patients displayed a T2 increase in at least one of the other ROIs. The VBR analysis showed a similar pattern of statistically significant areas of increased T2 within the sclerotic hippocampus. In addition, extrahippocampal areas of increased T2 were apparent including the anterior temporal lobe white matter and the parahippocampal gyrus. The results of the VBR analysis are in agreement with the conventional ROI analysis. The VBR analysis has the advantage of providing an even-handed assessment of T2 differences through the brain. We recommend VBR as an alternative means of relaxometry data analysis that provides an objective assessment of differences between subjects.},

abstract = {Heart rate fluctuations occur in the low-frequency range (<0.1 Hz) probed in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of resting-state functional connectivity and most fMRI block paradigms and may be related to low-frequency blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations. To investigate this hypothesis, temporal correlations between cardiac rate and resting-state fMRI signal timecourses were assessed at 3 T. Resting-state BOLD fMRI and accompanying physiological data were acquired and analyzed using cross-correlation and regression. Time-shifted cardiac rate timecourses were included as regressors in addition to established physiological regressors (RETROICOR (Glover, G.H., Li, T.Q., Ress, D., 2000. Image-based method for retrospective correction of physiological motion effects in fMRI: RETROICOR. Magn Reson Med 44, 162-167) and respiration volume per unit time (Birn, R.M., Diamond, J.B., Smith, M.A., Bandettini, P.A., 2006b. Separating respiratory-variation-related fluctuations from neuronal-activity-related fluctuations in fMRI. NeuroImage 31, 1536-1548). Significant correlations between the cardiac rate and BOLD signal timecourses were revealed, particularly negative correlations in gray matter at time shifts of 6-12 s and positive correlations at time shifts of 30-42 s (TR=6 s). Regressors consisting of cardiac rate timecourses shifted by delays of between 0 and 24 s explained an additional 1\% of the BOLD signal variance on average over the whole brain across 9 subjects, a similar additional variance to that explained by respiration volume per unit time and RETROICOR regressors, even when used in combination with these other physiological regressors. This suggests that including such time-shifted cardiac rate regressors will be beneficial for explaining physiological noise variance and will thereby improve the statistical power in future task-based and resting-state fMRI studies.},

@article{Friston2007,
abstract = {If one formulates Helmholtz's ideas about perception in terms of modern-day theories one arrives at a model of perceptual inference and learning that can explain a remarkable range of neurobiological facts. Using constructs from statistical physics it can be shown that the problems of inferring what cause our sensory input and learning causal regularities in the sensorium can be resolved using exactly the same principles. Furthermore, inference and learning can proceed in a biologically plausible fashion. The ensuing scheme rests on Empirical Bayes and hierarchical models of how sensory information is generated. The use of hierarchical models enables the brain to construct prior expectations in a dynamic and context-sensitive fashion. This scheme provides a principled way to understand many aspects of the brain's organisation and responses.In this paper, we suggest that these perceptual processes are just one emergent property of systems that conform to a free-energy principle. The free-energy considered here represents a bound on the surprise inherent in any exchange with the environment, under expectations encoded by its state or configuration. A system can minimise free-energy by changing its configuration to change the way it samples the environment, or to change its expectations. These changes correspond to action and perception respectively and lead to an adaptive exchange with the environment that is characteristic of biological systems. This treatment implies that the system's state and structure encode an implicit and probabilistic model of the environment. We will look at models entailed by the brain and how minimisation of free-energy can explain its dynamics and structure.},

abstract = {Cortical activity is the product of interactions among neuronal populations. Macroscopic electrophysiological phenomena are generated by these interactions. In principle, the mechanisms of these interactions afford constraints on biologically plausible models of electrophysiological responses. In other words, the macroscopic features of cortical activity can be modelled in terms of the microscopic behaviour of neurons. An evoked response potential (ERP) is the mean electrical potential measured from an electrode on the scalp, in response to some event. The purpose of this paper is to outline a population density approach to modelling ERPs. We propose a biologically plausible model of neuronal activity that enables the estimation of physiologically meaningful parameters from electrophysiological data. The model encompasses four basic characteristics of neuronal activity and organization: (i) neurons are dynamic units, (ii) driven by stochastic forces, (iii) organized into populations with similar biophysical properties and response characteristics and (iv) multiple populations interact to form functional networks. This leads to a formulation of population dynamics in terms of the Fokker-Planck equation. The solution of this equation is the temporal evolution of a probability density over state-space, representing the distribution of an ensemble of trajectories. Each trajectory corresponds to the changing state of a neuron. Measurements can be modelled by taking expectations over this density, e.g. mean membrane potential, firing rate or energy consumption per neuron. The key motivation behind our approach is that ERPs represent an average response over many neurons. This means it is sufficient to model the probability density over neurons, because this implicitly models their average state. Although the dynamics of each neuron can be highly stochastic, the dynamics of the density is not. This means we can use Bayesian inference and estimation tools that have already been established for deterministic systems. The potential importance of modelling density dynamics (as opposed to more conventional neural mass models) is that they include interactions among the moments of neuronal states (e.g. the mean depolarization may depend on the variance of synaptic currents through nonlinear mechanisms).Here, we formulate a population model, based on biologically informed model-neurons with spike-rate adaptation and synaptic dynamics. Neuronal sub-populations are coupled to form an observation model, with the aim of estimating and making inferences about coupling among sub-populations using real data. We approximate the time-dependent solution of the system using a bi-orthogonal set and first-order perturbation expansion. For didactic purposes, the model is developed first in the context of deterministic input, and then extended to include stochastic effects. The approach is demonstrated using synthetic data, where model parameters are identified using a Bayesian estimation scheme we have described previously.},

The method does not rely on a priori specification of a model that contains pre-selected regions and connections between them. This distinguishes it from other fMRI effective connectivity approaches that aim at testing or contrasting specific hypotheses about neuronal interactions. Instead, GCM relies on the concept of Granger causality to define the existence and direction of influence from information in the data. Temporal precedence information is exploited to compute Granger causality maps that identify voxels that are sources or targets of directed influence for any selected region-of-interest. We investigated the method by simulations and by application to fMRI data of a complex visuomotor task. The presented exploratory approach of mapping influences between a region of interest and the rest of the brain can form a useful complement to existing models of effective connectivity.},

abstract = {Invisibility devices have captured the human imagination for many years. Recent theories have proposed schemes for cloaking devices using transformation optics and conformal mapping. Metamaterials, with spatially tailored properties, have provided the necessary medium by enabling precise control over the flow of electromagnetic waves. Using metamaterials, the first microwave cloaking has been achieved but the realization of cloaking at optical frequencies, a key step towards achieving actual invisibility, has remained elusive. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of optical cloaking. The optical 'carpet' cloak is designed using quasi-conformal mapping to conceal an object that is placed under a curved reflecting surface by imitating the reflection of a flat surface. The cloak consists only of isotropic dielectric materials, which enables broadband and low-loss invisibility at a wavelength range of 1,400-1,800 nm.},

@article{Faisan2005,
abstract = {In this paper, a novel functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain mapping method is presented within the statistical modeling framework of hidden semi-Markov event sequence models (HSMESMs). Neural activation detection is formulated at the voxel level in terms of time coupling between the sequence of hemodynamic response onsets (HROs) observed in the fMRI signal, and an HSMESM of the hidden sequence of task-induced neural activations. The sequence of HRO events is derived from a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) of the fMRI signal. The brain activation HSMESM is built from the timing information of the input stimulation protocol. The rich mathematical framework of HSMESMs makes these models an effective and versatile approach for fMRI data analysis. Solving for the HSMESM Evaluation and Learning problems enables the model to automatically detect neural activation embedded in a given set of fMRI signals, without requiring any template basis function or prior shape assumption for the fMRI response. Solving for the HSMESM Decoding problem allows to enrich brain mapping with activation lag mapping, activation mode visualizing, and hemodynamic response function analysis. Activation detection results obtained on synthetic and real epoch-related fMRI data demonstrate the superiority of the HSMESM mapping method with respect to a real application case of the statistical parametric mapping (SPM) approach. In addition, the HSMESM mapping method appears clearly insensitive to timing variations of the hemodynamic response, and exhibits low sensitivity to fluctuations of its shape.},

In this work, we present a method for the automated classification of human thoughts reflected on a trial-based paradigm using fMRI with a significantly shortened data acquisition time (less than one minute). Based on our preliminary experience with various cognitive imagery tasks, six characteristic thoughts were chosen as target tasks for the present work: right-hand motor imagery, left-hand motor imagery, right foot motor imagery, mental calculation, internal speech/word generation, and visual imagery. These six tasks were performed by five healthy volunteers and functional images were obtained using a T(*)(2)-weighted echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence. Feature vectors from activation maps, necessary for the classification of neural activity, were automatically extracted from the regions that were consistently and exclusively activated for a given task during the training process. Extracted feature vectors were classified using the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. Parameter optimization, using a k-fold cross validation scheme, allowed the successful recognition of the six different categories of administered thought tasks with an accuracy of 74.5\% (mean)+/-14.3\% (standard deviation) across all five subjects. Our proposed study for the automated classification of fMRI data may be utilized in further investigations to monitor/identify human thought processes and their potential link to hardware/computer control.},

@article{Stephan2009,
abstract = {Functional integration in the brain rests on anatomical connectivity (the presence of axonal connections) and effective connectivity (the causal influences mediated by these connections). The deployment of anatomical connections provides important constraints on effective connectivity, but does not fully determine it, because synaptic connections can be expressed functionally in a dynamic and context-dependent fashion. Although it is generally assumed that anatomical connectivity data is important to guide the construction of neurobiologically realistic models of effective connectivity; the degree to which these models actually profit from anatomical constraints has not yet been formally investigated. Here, we use diffusion weighted imaging and probabilistic tractography to specify anatomically informed priors for dynamic causal models (DCMs) of fMRI data. We constructed 64 alternative DCMs, which embodied different mappings between the probability of an anatomical connection and the prior variance of the corresponding of effective connectivity, and fitted them to empirical fMRI data from 12 healthy subjects. Using Bayesian model selection, we show that the best model is one in which anatomical probability increases the prior variance of effective connectivity parameters in a nonlinear and monotonic (sigmoidal) fashion. This means that the higher the likelihood that a given connection exists anatomically, the larger one should set the prior variance of the corresponding coupling parameter; hence making it easier for the parameter to deviate from zero and represent a strong effective connection. To our knowledge, this study provides the first formal evidence that probabilistic knowledge of anatomical connectivity can improve models of functional integration.},

These images, acquired by measuring the attenuation of NMR signal due to directionally dependent diffusion, have recently been shown to be useful in the diagnosis and assessment of acute stroke and in mapping of tissue structure. This work presents an improvement on the spin-echo (SE) diffusion sequence that displays less distortion and consequently improves image quality. Adding a second refocusing pulse provides better image quality with less distortion at no cost in scanning efficiency or effectiveness, and allows more flexible diffusion gradient timing. By adjusting the timing of the diffusion gradients, eddy currents with a single exponential decay constant can be nulled, and eddy currents with similar decay constants can be greatly reduced. This new sequence is demonstrated in phantom measurements and in diffusion anisotropy images of normal human brain.},

The mechanism remains unknown, but the need for a long-term reduction in caloric intake to achieve these benefits has been assumed. We report that when C57BL6 mice are maintained on an intermittent fasting (alternate-day fasting) dietary-restriction regimen their overall food intake is not decreased and their body weight is maintained. Nevertheless, intermittent fasting resulted in beneficial effects that met or exceeded those of caloric restriction including reduced serum glucose and insulin levels and increased resistance of neurons in the brain to excitotoxic stress. Intermittent fasting therefore has beneficial effects on glucose regulation and neuronal resistance to injury in these mice that are independent of caloric intake.},

Previous fMRI studies have predicted a perceptual state by classifying brain activity into prespecified categories. Constraint-free visual image reconstruction is more challenging, as it is impractical to specify brain activity for all possible images. In this study, we reconstructed visual images by combining local image bases of multiple scales, whose contrasts were independently decoded from fMRI activity by automatically selecting relevant voxels and exploiting their correlated patterns. Binary-contrast, 10 x 10-patch images (2(100) possible states) were accurately reconstructed without any image prior on a single trial or volume basis by measuring brain activity only for several hundred random images. Reconstruction was also used to identify the presented image among millions of candidates. The results suggest that our approach provides an effective means to read out complex perceptual states from brain activity while discovering information representation in multivoxel patterns.},

Here, visual stimulation (14 secs flashing checkerboard) and breath-hold (4 secs exhale+14 secs breath hold) experiments were performed in alternating sequence on healthy volunteers using BOLD, CBV-weighted, and CBF-weighted fMRI. After visual stimulation, the BOLD signal persisted for 33+/-5 secs (n=9) and was biphasic with a negative component (undershoot), whereas CBV and CBF returned to baseline without an undershoot at 20+/-5 and 20+/-3 secs, respectively. After breath hold, the BOLD signal returned to baseline (23+/-7 secs) at the same time (P>0.05) as CBV (21+/-6 secs) and CBF (18+/-3 secs), without a poststimulus undershoot. These data suggest that the BOLD undershoot after visual activation reflects a persistent increase in CMRO(2). These observations support the view that CBV and CBF responses elicited by neuronal activation are not necessarily coupled to local tissue metabolism.},

abstract = {When modelling FMRI and other MRI time-series data, a Bayesian approach based on adaptive spatial smoothness priors is a compelling alternative to using a standard generalized linear model (GLM) on presmoothed data. Another benefit of the Bayesian approach is that biophysical prior information can be incorporated in a principled manner; however, this requirement for a fixed non-spatial prior on a parameter would normally preclude using spatial regularization on that same parameter. We have developed a Gaussian-process-based prior to apply adaptive spatial regularization while still ensuring that the fixed biophysical prior is correctly applied on each voxel. A parameterized covariance matrix provides separate control over the variance (the diagonal elements) and the between-voxel correlation (due to off-diagonal elements). Analysis proceeds using evidence optimization (EO), with variational Bayes (VB) updates used for some parameters. The method can also be applied to non-linear forward models by using a linear Taylor expansion centred on the latest parameter estimates. Applying the method to FMRI with a constrained haemodynamic response function (HRF) shape model shows improved fits in simulations, compared to using either the non-spatial or spatial-smoothness prior alone. We also analyse multi-inversion arterial spin labelling data using a non-linear perfusion model to estimate cerebral blood flow and bolus arrival time. By combining both types of prior information, this new prior performs consistently well across a wider range of situations than either prior alone, and provides better estimates when both types of prior information are relevant.},

abstract = {Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) is a method for estimating and making inferences about the coupling among small numbers of brain areas, and the influence of experimental manipulations on that coupling [Friston, K.J., Harrison, L., Penny, W., 2003 Dynamic causal modelling. Neuroimage 19, 1273-1302]. Large-scale neural modelling aims to construct neurobiologically grounded computational models with emergent behaviours that inform our understanding of neuronal systems. One such model has been used to simulate region-specific BOLD time-series [Horwitz, B., Friston, K.J., Taylor, J.G., 2000. Neural modeling and functional brain imaging: an overview. Neural Netw. 13, 829-846]. DCM was used to make inferences about effective connectivity using data generated by a model implementing a visual delayed match-to-sample task [Tagamets, M.A., Horwitz, B., 1998. Integrating electrophysiological and anatomical experimental data to create a large-scale model that simulates a delayed match-to-sample human brain imaging study. Cereb. Cortex 8, 310-320]. The aim was to explore the validity of inferences made using DCM about the connectivity structure and task-dependent modulatory effects, in a system with a known connectivity structure. We also examined the effects of misspecifying regions of interest. Models with hierarchical connectivity and reciprocal connections were examined using DCM and Bayesian Model Comparison [Penny, W.D., Stephan, K.E., Mechelli, A., Friston, K.J., 2004. Comparing dynamic causal models. Neuroimage 22, 1157-1172]. This approach revealed strong evidence for those models with correctly specified anatomical connectivity. Furthermore, Bayesian model comparison favoured those models when bilinear effects corresponded to their implementation in the neural model. These findings generalised to an extended model with two additional areas and reentrant circuits. The conditional uncertainty of coupling parameter estimates increased in proportion to the number of incorrectly specified regions. These results highlight the role of neural models in establishing the validity of estimation and inference schemes. Specifically, Bayesian model comparison confirms the validity of DCM in relation to a well-characterised and comprehensive neuronal model.},

The standard approach uses linear convolution models that relate experimentally designed inputs, through a haemodynamic response function, to observed blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals. Such models are, however, blind to the causal mechanisms that underlie observed BOLD responses. Recent developments have focused on how BOLD responses are generated and include biophysical input-state-output models with neural and haemodynamic state equations and models of functional integration that explain local dynamics through interactions with remote areas. Forward models with parameters at the neural level, such as dynamic causal modelling, combine both approaches, modelling the whole causal chain from external stimuli, via induced neural dynamics, to observed BOLD responses.},

It is also a critical component in the design and analysis of functional neuroimaging studies. To study the linearity of the CBF response to different duration stimuli, the perfusion response in primary motor and visual cortices was measured during stimulation using an arterial spin labeling technique with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that allows simultaneous measurement of CBF and BOLD changes. In each study, the perfusion response was measured for stimuli lasting 2, 6, and 18 sec. The CBF response was found in general to be nonlinearly related to stimulus duration, although the strength of nonlinearity varied between the motor and visual cortices. In contrast, the BOLD response was found to be strongly nonlinear in both regions studied, in agreement with previous findings. The observed nonlinearities are consistent with a model with a nonlinear step from stimulus to neural activity, a linear step from neural activity to CBF change, and a nonlinear step from CBF change to BOLD signal change.},

abstract = {Neural activity in the brain is accompanied by changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and blood oxygenation that are detectable with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques. In this paper, recent mathematical models of this hemodynamic response are reviewed and integrated. Models are described for: (1) the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal as a function of changes in cerebral oxygen extraction fraction (E) and cerebral blood volume (CBV); (2) the balloon model, proposed to describe the transient dynamics of CBV and deoxy-hemoglobin (Hb) and how they affect the BOLD signal; (3) neurovascular coupling, relating the responses in CBF and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2)) to the neural activity response; and (4) a simple model for the temporal nonlinearity of the neural response itself. These models are integrated into a mathematical framework describing the steps linking a stimulus to the measured BOLD and CBF responses. Experimental results examining transient features of the BOLD response (post-stimulus undershoot and initial dip), nonlinearities of the hemodynamic response, and the role of the physiologic baseline state in altering the BOLD signal are discussed in the context of the proposed models. Quantitative modeling of the hemodynamic response, when combined with experimental data measuring both the BOLD and CBF responses, makes possible a more specific and quantitative assessment of brain physiology than is possible with standard BOLD imaging alone. This approach has the potential to enhance numerous studies of brain function in development, health, and disease.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forepaw stimulation and hypercapnic challenge on rats were studied. CBF and BOLD functional MRI (fMRI) were measured using the pseudo-continuous arterial spin-labeling technique at 500-msec resolution. CBV fMRI was measured using monocrystalline iron-oxide particles following CBF and BOLD measurements in the same animals. CMRO(2) change was estimated via the biophysical BOLD model with hypercapnic calibration. Percent changes and onset times were analyzed for the entire forepaw somatosensory cortices and three operationally defined cortical segments, denoted Layers I-III, IV-V, and VI. RESULTS: BOLD change was largest in Layers I-III, whereas CBF, CBV, and CMRO(2) changes were largest in Layers IV-V. Among all fMRI signals in all layers, only the BOLD signal in Layers I-III showed a poststimulus undershoot. CBF and CBV dynamics were similar. Closer inspection showed that CBV increased slightly first (P < 0.05), but was slow to peak. CBF increased second, but peaked first. BOLD significantly lagged both CBF and CBV (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study provides important temporal dynamics of multiple fMRI signals at high temporal resolution in a single setting.},

The model has three compartments to take into account the fact that the cerebral blood flow and volume as measured concurrently using laser Doppler flowmetry and optical imaging spectroscopy have contributions from the arterial, capillary as well as the venous compartments of the vasculature. It is an extension to previous one-compartment hemodynamic models which assume that the measured blood volume changes are from the venous compartment only. An important assumption of the model is that the tissue oxygen concentration is a time varying state variable of the system and is driven by the changes in metabolic demand resulting from changes in neural activity. The model takes into account the pre-capillary oxygen diffusion by flexibly allowing the saturation of the arterial compartment to be less than unity. Simulations are used to explore the sensitivity of the model and to optimise the parameters for experimental data. We conclude that the three-compartment model was better than the one-compartment model at capturing the hemodynamics of the response to changes in neural activation following stimulation.},

Using metamaterials, the first microwave cloaking has been achieved but the realization of cloaking at optical frequencies, a key step towards achieving actual invisibility, has remained elusive. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of optical cloaking. The optical 'carpet' cloak is designed using quasi-conformal mapping to conceal an object that is placed under a curved reflecting surface by imitating the reflection of a flat surface. The cloak consists only of isotropic dielectric materials, which enables broadband and low-loss invisibility at a wavelength range of 1,400-1,800 nm.},

abstract = {We present a new method, laminar population analysis (LPA), for analysis of laminar-electrode (linear multielectrode) data, where physiological constraints are explicitly incorporated in the mathematical model: the high-frequency band [multiunit activity (MUA)] is modeled as a sum over contributions from firing activity of multiple cortical populations, whereas the low-frequency band [local field potential (LFP)] is assumed to reflect the dendritic currents caused by synaptic inputs evoked by this firing. The method is applied to stimulus-averaged laminar-electrode data from barrel cortex of anesthetized rat after single whisker flicks. Two sample data sets, distinguished by stimulus paradigm, type of applied anesthesia, and electrical boundary conditions, are studied in detail. These data sets are well accounted for by a model with four cortical populations: one supragranular, one granular, and two infragranular populations. Population current source densities (CSDs; the CSD signatures after firing in a particular population) provided by LPA are further used to estimate the synaptic connection pattern between the various populations using a new LFP template-fitting technique, where LFP population templates are found by the electrostatic forward solution based on results from compartmental modeling of morphologically reconstructed neurons. Our analysis confirms previous experimental findings regarding the synaptic connections from neurons in the granular layer onto neurons in the supragranular layers and provides predictions about other synaptic connections. Furthermore, the time dependence of the stimulus-evoked population firing activity is predicted, and the temporal ordering of response onset is found to be compatible with earlier findings.},

abstract = {A new method for estimation of current-source density (CSD) from local field potentials is presented. This inverse CSD (iCSD) method is based on explicit inversion of the electrostatic forward solution and can be applied to data from multielectrode arrays with various geometries. Here, the method is applied to linear-array (laminar) electrode data. Three iCSD methods are considered: the CSD is assumed to have cylindrical symmetry and be (i) localized in infinitely thin discs, (ii) step-wise constant or (iii) continuous and smoothly varying (using cubic splines) in the vertical direction. For spatially confined CSD distributions the standard CSD method, involving a discrete double derivative, is seen in model calculations to give significant estimation errors when the lateral source dimension is comparable to the size of a cortical column (less than approximately 1 mm). Further, discontinuities in the extracellular conductivity are seen to potentially give sizable errors for even wider source distributions. The iCSD methods are seen to give excellent estimates when the correct lateral source dimension and spatial distribution of conductivity are incorporated. To illustrate the application to real data, iCSD estimates of stimulus-evoked responses measured with laminar electrodes in the rat somatosensory (barrel) cortex are compared to estimates from the standard CSD method.},

These images, acquired by measuring the attenuation of NMR signal due to directionally dependent diffusion, have recently been shown to be useful in the diagnosis and assessment of acute stroke and in mapping of tissue structure. This work presents an improvement on the spin-echo (SE) diffusion sequence that displays less distortion and consequently improves image quality. Adding a second refocusing pulse provides better image quality with less distortion at no cost in scanning efficiency or effectiveness, and allows more flexible diffusion gradient timing. By adjusting the timing of the diffusion gradients, eddy currents with a single exponential decay constant can be nulled, and eddy currents with similar decay constants can be greatly reduced. This new sequence is demonstrated in phantom measurements and in diffusion anisotropy images of normal human brain.},

abstract = {The interpretation of the blood-oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) post-stimulus undershoot has been a topic of considerable interest, as the mechanisms behind this prominent BOLD transient may provide valuable clues on the neurovascular response process and energy supply routes of the brain. Biomechanical theories explain the origin of the BOLD undershoot through the passive ballooning of post-capillary vessels which leads to an increase in venous blood volume (CBV(v), comprising deoxygenated blood in capillary, venular and arteriolar compartments), resulting in susceptibility-induced signal decrease. While there has been substantial evidence supporting a role for venous ballooning, there have also been reports arguing for a prolonged post-stimulus elevation in cerebral oxygenation consumption (CMRo(2)) as the primary cause. Furthermore, a contribution of post-stimulus cerebral blood flow (CBF) undershoots has also been demonstrated. To clarify the role of the venous compartment in causing the BOLD undershoot, we performed in vivo fMRI measurements of the transient DeltaCBV(v), DeltaCBF and DeltaBOLD responses in healthy humans. We observed a slow post-stimulus return to baseline in venous CBV which supports the existence of a passive "balloon" effect, implying that previous observations of a quicker recovery of the total CBV response may be dominated by arterial CBV change. Our findings also support a significant contribution from the CBF undershoots, which, combined with a slow venous CBV response, would account for much of the BOLD undershoot.},

abstract = {Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) is a method for estimating and making inferences about the coupling among small numbers of brain areas, and the influence of experimental manipulations on that coupling [Friston, K.J., Harrison, L., Penny, W., 2003 Dynamic causal modelling. Neuroimage 19, 1273-1302]. Large-scale neural modelling aims to construct neurobiologically grounded computational models with emergent behaviours that inform our understanding of neuronal systems. One such model has been used to simulate region-specific BOLD time-series [Horwitz, B., Friston, K.J., Taylor, J.G., 2000. Neural modeling and functional brain imaging: an overview. Neural Netw. 13, 829-846]. DCM was used to make inferences about effective connectivity using data generated by a model implementing a visual delayed match-to-sample task [Tagamets, M.A., Horwitz, B., 1998. Integrating electrophysiological and anatomical experimental data to create a large-scale model that simulates a delayed match-to-sample human brain imaging study. Cereb. Cortex 8, 310-320]. The aim was to explore the validity of inferences made using DCM about the connectivity structure and task-dependent modulatory effects, in a system with a known connectivity structure. We also examined the effects of misspecifying regions of interest. Models with hierarchical connectivity and reciprocal connections were examined using DCM and Bayesian Model Comparison [Penny, W.D., Stephan, K.E., Mechelli, A., Friston, K.J., 2004. Comparing dynamic causal models. Neuroimage 22, 1157-1172]. This approach revealed strong evidence for those models with correctly specified anatomical connectivity. Furthermore, Bayesian model comparison favoured those models when bilinear effects corresponded to their implementation in the neural model. These findings generalised to an extended model with two additional areas and reentrant circuits. The conditional uncertainty of coupling parameter estimates increased in proportion to the number of incorrectly specified regions. These results highlight the role of neural models in establishing the validity of estimation and inference schemes. Specifically, Bayesian model comparison confirms the validity of DCM in relation to a well-characterised and comprehensive neuronal model.},

abstract = {The goal of our research is to develop an experimental and analytical framework for spatiotemporal imaging of human brain function. Preliminary studies suggest that noninvasive spatiotemporal maps of cerebral activity can be produced by combining the high spatial resolution (millimeters) of functional MRI (fMRI) with the high temporal resolution (milliseconds) of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Although MEG and EEG are sensitive to millisecond changes in mental activity, the ability to resolve source localization and timing is limited by the ill-posed "inverse" problem. We conducted Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the use of MRI constraints in a linear estimation inverse procedure, where fMRI weighting, cortical location and orientation, and sensor noise statistics were realistically incorporated. An error metric was computed to quantify the effects of fMRI invisible ("missing") sources, "extra" fMRI sources, and cortical orientation errors. Our simulation results demonstrate that prior anatomical and functional information from MRI can be used to regularize the EEG/MEG inverse problem, giving an improved solution with high spatial and temporal resolution. An fMRI weighting of approximately 90\% was determined to provide the best compromise between separation of activity from correctly localized sources and minimization of error caused by missing sources. The accuracy of the estimate was relatively independent of the number and extent of the sources, allowing for incorporation of physiologically realistic multiple distributed sources. This linear estimation method provides an operator-independent approach for combining information from fMRI, MEG, and EEG and represents a significant advance over traditional dipole modeling.},

These are obtained by maximising a variational action with respect to conditional densities, under a fixed-form assumption about their form. The action or path-integral of free-energy represents a lower bound on the model's log-evidence or marginal likelihood required for model selection and averaging. This approach rests on formulating the optimisation dynamically, in generalised coordinates of motion. The resulting scheme can be used for online Bayesian inversion of nonlinear dynamic causal models and is shown to outperform existing approaches, such as Kalman and particle filtering. Furthermore, it provides for dual and triple inferences on a system's states, parameters and hyperparameters using exactly the same principles. We refer to this approach as dynamic expectation maximisation (DEM).},

abstract = {Functional integration in the brain rests on anatomical connectivity (the presence of axonal connections) and effective connectivity (the causal influences mediated by these connections). The deployment of anatomical connections provides important constraints on effective connectivity, but does not fully determine it, because synaptic connections can be expressed functionally in a dynamic and context-dependent fashion. Although it is generally assumed that anatomical connectivity data is important to guide the construction of neurobiologically realistic models of effective connectivity; the degree to which these models actually profit from anatomical constraints has not yet been formally investigated. Here, we use diffusion weighted imaging and probabilistic tractography to specify anatomically informed priors for dynamic causal models (DCMs) of fMRI data. We constructed 64 alternative DCMs, which embodied different mappings between the probability of an anatomical connection and the prior variance of the corresponding of effective connectivity, and fitted them to empirical fMRI data from 12 healthy subjects. Using Bayesian model selection, we show that the best model is one in which anatomical probability increases the prior variance of effective connectivity parameters in a nonlinear and monotonic (sigmoidal) fashion. This means that the higher the likelihood that a given connection exists anatomically, the larger one should set the prior variance of the corresponding coupling parameter; hence making it easier for the parameter to deviate from zero and represent a strong effective connection. To our knowledge, this study provides the first formal evidence that probabilistic knowledge of anatomical connectivity can improve models of functional integration.},

abstract = {If one formulates Helmholtz's ideas about perception in terms of modern-day theories one arrives at a model of perceptual inference and learning that can explain a remarkable range of neurobiological facts. Using constructs from statistical physics it can be shown that the problems of inferring what cause our sensory input and learning causal regularities in the sensorium can be resolved using exactly the same principles. Furthermore, inference and learning can proceed in a biologically plausible fashion. The ensuing scheme rests on Empirical Bayes and hierarchical models of how sensory information is generated. The use of hierarchical models enables the brain to construct prior expectations in a dynamic and context-sensitive fashion. This scheme provides a principled way to understand many aspects of the brain's organisation and responses.In this paper, we suggest that these perceptual processes are just one emergent property of systems that conform to a free-energy principle. The free-energy considered here represents a bound on the surprise inherent in any exchange with the environment, under expectations encoded by its state or configuration. A system can minimise free-energy by changing its configuration to change the way it samples the environment, or to change its expectations. These changes correspond to action and perception respectively and lead to an adaptive exchange with the environment that is characteristic of biological systems. This treatment implies that the system's state and structure encode an implicit and probabilistic model of the environment. We will look at models entailed by the brain and how minimisation of free-energy can explain its dynamics and structure.},

abstract = {This paper reviews hierarchical observation models, used in functional neuroimaging, in a Bayesian light. It emphasizes the common ground shared by classical and Bayesian methods to show that conventional analyses of neuroimaging data can be usefully extended within an empirical Bayesian framework. In particular we formulate the procedures used in conventional data analysis in terms of hierarchical linear models and establish a connection between classical inference and parametric empirical Bayes (PEB) through covariance component estimation. This estimation is based on an expectation maximization or EM algorithm. The key point is that hierarchical models not only provide for appropriate inference at the highest level but that one can revisit lower levels suitably equipped to make Bayesian inferences. Bayesian inferences eschew many of the difficulties encountered with classical inference and characterize brain responses in a way that is more directly predicated on what one is interested in. The motivation for Bayesian approaches is reviewed and the theoretical background is presented in a way that relates to conventional methods, in particular restricted maximum likelihood (ReML). This paper is a technical and theoretical prelude to subsequent papers that deal with applications of the theory to a range of important issues in neuroimaging. These issues include; (i) Estimating nonsphericity or variance components in fMRI time-series that can arise from serial correlations within subject, or are induced by multisubject (i.e., hierarchical) studies. (ii) Spatiotemporal Bayesian models for imaging data, in which voxels-specific effects are constrained by responses in other voxels. (iii) Bayesian estimation of nonlinear models of hemodynamic responses and (iv) principled ways of mixing structural and functional priors in EEG source reconstruction. Although diverse, all these estimation problems are accommodated by the PEB framework described in this paper.},

abstract = {Models of effective connectivity characterize the influence that neuronal populations exert over each other. Additionally, some approaches, for example Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) and variants of Structural Equation Modelling, describe how effective connectivity is modulated by experimental manipulations. Mathematically, both are based on bilinear equations, where the bilinear term models the effect of experimental manipulations on neuronal interactions. The bilinear framework, however, precludes an important aspect of neuronal interactions that has been established with invasive electrophysiological recording studies; i.e., how the connection between two neuronal units is enabled or gated by activity in other units. These gating processes are critical for controlling the gain of neuronal populations and are mediated through interactions between synaptic inputs (e.g. by means of voltage-sensitive ion channels). They represent a key mechanism for various neurobiological processes, including top-down (e.g. attentional) modulation, learning and neuromodulation. This paper presents a nonlinear extension of DCM that models such processes (to second order) at the neuronal population level. In this way, the modulation of network interactions can be assigned to an explicit neuronal population. We present simulations and empirical results that demonstrate the validity and usefulness of this model. Analyses of synthetic data showed that nonlinear and bilinear mechanisms can be distinguished by our extended DCM. When applying the model to empirical fMRI data from a blocked attention to motion paradigm, we found that attention-induced increases in V5 responses could be best explained as a gating of the V1-->V5 connection by activity in posterior parietal cortex. Furthermore, we analysed fMRI data from an event-related binocular rivalry paradigm and found that interactions amongst percept-selective visual areas were modulated by activity in the middle frontal gyrus. In both practical examples, Bayesian model selection favoured the nonlinear models over corresponding bilinear ones.},

abstract = {Although progress has been made in relating neuronal events to changes in brain metabolism and blood flow, the interpretation of functional neuroimaging data in terms of the underlying brain circuits is still poorly understood. Computational modeling of connection patterns both among and within regions can be helpful in this interpretation. We present a neural network model of the ventral visual pathway and its relevant functional connections. This includes a new learning method that adjusts the magnitude of interregional connections in order to match experimental results of an arbitrary functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data set. We demonstrate that this method finds the appropriate connection strengths when trained on a model system with known, randomly chosen connection weights. We then use the method for examining fMRI results from a one-back matching task in human subjects, both healthy and those with schizophrenia. The results discovered by the learning method support previous findings of a disconnection between left temporal and frontal cortices in the group with schizophrenia and a concomitant increase of right-sided temporo-frontal connection strengths. We then demonstrate that the disconnection may be explained by reduced local recurrent circuitry in frontal cortex. This method extends currently available methods for estimating functional connectivity from human imaging data by including both local circuits and features of interregional connections, such as topography and sparseness, in addition to total connection strengths. Furthermore, our results suggest how fronto-temporal functional disconnection in schizophrenia can result from reduced local synaptic connections within frontal cortex rather than compromised interregional connections.},

@article{Harrison2005a,
abstract = {Cortical activity is the product of interactions among neuronal populations. Macroscopic electrophysiological phenomena are generated by these interactions. In principle, the mechanisms of these interactions afford constraints on biologically plausible models of electrophysiological responses. In other words, the macroscopic features of cortical activity can be modelled in terms of the microscopic behaviour of neurons. An evoked response potential (ERP) is the mean electrical potential measured from an electrode on the scalp, in response to some event. The purpose of this paper is to outline a population density approach to modelling ERPs. We propose a biologically plausible model of neuronal activity that enables the estimation of physiologically meaningful parameters from electrophysiological data. The model encompasses four basic characteristics of neuronal activity and organization: (i) neurons are dynamic units, (ii) driven by stochastic forces, (iii) organized into populations with similar biophysical properties and response characteristics and (iv) multiple populations interact to form functional networks. This leads to a formulation of population dynamics in terms of the Fokker-Planck equation. The solution of this equation is the temporal evolution of a probability density over state-space, representing the distribution of an ensemble of trajectories. Each trajectory corresponds to the changing state of a neuron. Measurements can be modelled by taking expectations over this density, e.g. mean membrane potential, firing rate or energy consumption per neuron. The key motivation behind our approach is that ERPs represent an average response over many neurons. This means it is sufficient to model the probability density over neurons, because this implicitly models their average state. Although the dynamics of each neuron can be highly stochastic, the dynamics of the density is not. This means we can use Bayesian inference and estimation tools that have already been established for deterministic systems. The potential importance of modelling density dynamics (as opposed to more conventional neural mass models) is that they include interactions among the moments of neuronal states (e.g. the mean depolarization may depend on the variance of synaptic currents through nonlinear mechanisms).Here, we formulate a population model, based on biologically informed model-neurons with spike-rate adaptation and synaptic dynamics. Neuronal sub-populations are coupled to form an observation model, with the aim of estimating and making inferences about coupling among sub-populations using real data. We approximate the time-dependent solution of the system using a bi-orthogonal set and first-order perturbation expansion. For didactic purposes, the model is developed first in the context of deterministic input, and then extended to include stochastic effects. The approach is demonstrated using synthetic data, where model parameters are identified using a Bayesian estimation scheme we have described previously.},

abstract = {A new method is presented for extraction of population firing-rate models for both thalamocortical and intracortical signal transfer based on stimulus-evoked data from simultaneous thalamic single-electrode and cortical recordings using linear (laminar) multielectrodes in the rat barrel system. Time-dependent population firing rates for granular (layer 4), supragranular (layer 2/3), and infragranular (layer 5) populations in a barrel column and the thalamic population in the homologous barreloid are extracted from the high-frequency portion (multi-unit activity; MUA) of the recorded extracellular signals. These extracted firing rates are in turn used to identify population firing-rate models formulated as integral equations with exponentially decaying coupling kernels, allowing for straightforward transformation to the more common firing-rate formulation in terms of differential equations. Optimal model structures and model parameters are identified by minimizing the deviation between model firing rates and the experimentally extracted population firing rates. For the thalamocortical transfer, the experimental data favor a model with fast feedforward excitation from thalamus to the layer-4 laminar population combined with a slower inhibitory process due to feedforward and/or recurrent connections and mixed linear-parabolic activation functions. The extracted firing rates of the various cortical laminar populations are found to exhibit strong temporal correlations for the present experimental paradigm, and simple feedforward population firing-rate models combined with linear or mixed linear-parabolic activation function are found to provide excellent fits to the data. The identified thalamocortical and intracortical network models are thus found to be qualitatively very different. While the thalamocortical circuit is optimally stimulated by rapid changes in the thalamic firing rate, the intracortical circuits are low-pass and respond most strongly to slowly varying inputs from the cortical layer-4 population.},

abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based on blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast is the most widely used technique for imaging human brain function. However, the dynamic interplay of altered cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and oxidative metabolism (CMRO2) is not yet fully understood. One of the characteristics of the BOLD response is the post-stimulation undershoot, that is increased deoxyhemoglobin, which has been suggested to originate from a delayed recovery of elevated CBV or CMRO2 to baseline. To investigate the CBV contribution to the post-stimulation BOLD undershoot, we performed bolus-tracking experiments using a paramagnetic contrast agent in eight healthy subjects at 3 T. In an initial BOLD experiment without contrast agent, we determined the individual hemodynamic responsiveness. In two separate experiments, we then evaluated the relative CBV (rCBV) during visual stimulation and the post-stimulation undershoot, respectively. The results confirm a pronounced rCBV increase during stimulation (31.4+/-8.6\%), but reveal no change in rCBV relative to baseline in the post-stimulation phase (0.7+/-7.2\%). This finding renders a CBV contribution to the BOLD MRI undershoot unlikely and--in conjunction with a rapid post-stimulation return of CBF to baseline--supports the idea of a prolonged elevation of oxidative metabolism.},

There is increasing evidence that the magnitude and temporal characteristics of these evoked hemodynamic changes are additionally influenced by the local properties of the vasculature including the levels of baseline cerebral blood flow, volume, and blood oxygenation. In this work, we utilize a physiologically motivated vascular model to describe the temporal characteristics of evoked hemodynamic responses and their expected relationships to the structural and biomechanical properties of the underlying vasculature. We use this model in a temporal curve-fitting analysis of the high-temporal resolution functional MRI data to estimate the underlying cerebral vascular and metabolic responses in the brain. We present evidence for the feasibility of our model-based analysis to estimate transient changes in the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2)) in the human motor cortex from combined pulsed arterial spin labeling (ASL) and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) MRI. We examine both the numerical characteristics of this model and present experimental evidence to support this model by examining concurrently measured ASL, BOLD, and near-infrared spectroscopy to validate the calculated changes in underlying CMRO(2).},

abstract = {The blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal does not measure neuronal activity directly. This fact is a key concern for interpreting functional imaging data based on BOLD. Mathematical models describing the path from neural activity to the BOLD response allow us to numerically solve the inverse problem of estimating the timing and amplitude of the neuronal activity underlying the BOLD signal. In fact, these models can be viewed as an advanced substitute for the impulse response function. In this work, the issue of estimating the dynamics of neuronal activity from the observed BOLD signal is considered within the framework of optimization problems. The model is based on the extended "balloon" model and describes the conversion of neuronal signals into the BOLD response through the transitional dynamics of the blood flow-inducing signal, cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume and deoxyhemoglobin concentration. Global optimization techniques are applied to find a control input (the neuronal activity and/or the biophysical parameters in the model) that causes the system to follow an admissible solution to minimize discrepancy between model and experimental data. As an alternative to a local linearization (LL) filtering scheme, the optimization method escapes the linearization of the transition system and provides a possibility to search for the global optimum, avoiding spurious local minima. We have found that the dynamics of the neural signals and the physiological variables as well as the biophysical parameters can be robustly reconstructed from the BOLD responses. Furthermore, it is shown that spiking off/on dynamics of the neural activity is the natural mathematical solution of the model. Incorporating, in addition, the expansion of the neural input by smooth basis functions, representing a low-pass filtering, allows us to model local field potential (LFP) solutions instead of spiking solutions.},

Multivariate models with general covariance structure are often difficult to apply to highly unbalanced data, whereas two-stage random-effects models can be used easily. In two-stage models, the probability distributions for the response vectors of different individuals belong to a single family, but some random-effects parameters vary across individuals, with a distribution specified at the second stage. A general family of models is discussed, which includes both growth models and repeated-measures models as special cases. A unified approach to fitting these models, based on a combination of empirical Bayes and maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters and using the EM algorithm, is discussed. Two examples are taken from a current epidemiological study of the health effects of air pollution.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the estimation of the blood oxygen level-dependent response to a stimulus, as measured in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. A precise estimation is essential for a better understanding of cerebral activations. The most recent works have used a nonparametric framework for this estimation, considering each brain region as a system characterized by its impulse response, the so-called hemodynamic response function (HRF). However, the use of these techniques has remained limited since they are not well-adapted to real fMRI data. Here, we develop a threefold extension to previous works. We consider asynchronous event-related paradigms, account for different trial types and integrate several fMRI sessions into the estimation. These generalizations are simultaneously addressed through a badly conditioned observation model. Bayesian formalism is used to model temporal prior information of the underlying physiological process of the brain hemodynamic response. By this way, the HRF estimate results from a tradeoff between information brought by the data and by our prior knowledge. This tradeoff is modeled with hyperparameters that are set to the maximum-likelihood estimate using an expectation conditional maximization algorithm. The proposed unsupervised approach is validated on both synthetic and real fMRI data, the latter originating from a speech perception experiment.},

abstract = {In BOLD fMRI data analysis, robust and accurate estimation of the Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF) is still under investigation. Parametric methods assume the shape of the HRF to be known and constant throughout the brain, whereas non-parametric methods mostly rely on artificially increasing the signal-to-noise ratio. We extend and develop a previously proposed method that makes use of basic yet relevant temporal information about the underlying physiological process of the brain BOLD response in order to infer the HRF in a Bayesian framework. A general hypothesis test is also proposed, allowing to take advantage of the knowledge gained regarding the HRF to perform activation detection. The performances of the method are then evaluated by simulation. Great improvement is shown compared to the Maximum-Likelihood estimate in terms of estimation error, variance, and bias. Robustness of the estimators with regard to the actual noise structure or level, as well as the stimulus sequence, is also proven. Lastly, fMRI data with an event-related paradigm are analyzed. As suspected, the regions selected from highly discriminating activation maps resulting from the method exhibit a certain inter-regional homogeneity in term of HRF shape, as well as noticeable inter-regional differences.},

abstract = {Estimates of hemodynamic response functions (HRF) are often integral parts of event-related fMRI analyses. Although HRFs vary across individuals and brain regions, few studies have investigated how variations affect the results of statistical analyses using the general linear model (GLM). In this study, we empirically estimated HRFs from primary motor and visual cortices and frontal and supplementary eye fields (SEF) in 20 subjects. We observed more variability across subjects than regions and correlated variation of time-to-peak values across several pairs of regions. Simulations examined the effects of observed variability on statistical results and ways different experimental designs and statistical models can limit these effects. Widely spaced and rapid event-related experimental designs with two sampling rates were tested. Statistical models compared an empirically derived HRF to a canonical HRF and included the first derivative of the HRF in the GLM. Small differences between the estimated and true HRFs did not cause false negatives, but larger differences within an observed range of variation, such as a 2.5-s time-to-onset misestimate, led to false negatives. Although small errors minimally affected detection of activity, time-to-onset misestimates as small as 1 s influenced model parameter estimation and therefore random effects analyses across subjects. Experiment and analysis design methods such as decreasing the sampling rate or including the HRF's temporal derivative in the GLM improved results, but did not eliminate errors caused by HRF misestimates. These results highlight the benefits of determining the best possible HRF estimate and potential negative consequences of assuming HRF consistency across subjects or brain regions.},

abstract = {Signal variations in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging experiments essentially reflect the vascular system response to increased demand for oxygen caused by neuronal activity, termed the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) effect. The most comprehensive model to date of the BOLD signal is formulated as a mixed continuous-discrete-time system of nonlinear stochastic differential equations. Previous approaches to the analysis of this system have been based on linearised approximations of the dynamics, which are limited in their ability to capture the inherent nonlinearities in the physiological system. In this paper we present a nonlinear filtering method for simultaneous estimation of the hidden physiological states and the system parameters, based on an iterative coordinate descent framework. State estimates of the cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume and deoxyhaemoglobin content are determined using a particle filter, demonstrated via simulation to be accurate, robust and efficient in comparison to linearisation-based techniques. The adaptive state and parameter estimation algorithm generates physiologically reasonable parameter estimates for experimental fMRI data. It is anticipated that signal processing techniques for modelling and estimation will become increasingly important in fMRI analyses as limitations of linear and linearised modelling are reached.},

abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based on blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast is the most widely used technique for imaging human brain function. However, the dynamic interplay of altered cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and oxidative metabolism (CMRO2) is not yet fully understood. One of the characteristics of the BOLD response is the post-stimulation undershoot, that is increased deoxyhemoglobin, which has been suggested to originate from a delayed recovery of elevated CBV or CMRO2 to baseline. To investigate the CBV contribution to the post-stimulation BOLD undershoot, we performed bolus-tracking experiments using a paramagnetic contrast agent in eight healthy subjects at 3 T. In an initial BOLD experiment without contrast agent, we determined the individual hemodynamic responsiveness. In two separate experiments, we then evaluated the relative CBV (rCBV) during visual stimulation and the post-stimulation undershoot, respectively. The results confirm a pronounced rCBV increase during stimulation (31.4+/-8.6\%), but reveal no change in rCBV relative to baseline in the post-stimulation phase (0.7+/-7.2\%). This finding renders a CBV contribution to the BOLD MRI undershoot unlikely and--in conjunction with a rapid post-stimulation return of CBF to baseline--supports the idea of a prolonged elevation of oxidative metabolism.},

@article{Chen2009,
abstract = {The interpretation of the blood-oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) post-stimulus undershoot has been a topic of considerable interest, as the mechanisms behind this prominent BOLD transient may provide valuable clues on the neurovascular response process and energy supply routes of the brain. Biomechanical theories explain the origin of the BOLD undershoot through the passive ballooning of post-capillary vessels which leads to an increase in venous blood volume (CBV(v), comprising deoxygenated blood in capillary, venular and arteriolar compartments), resulting in susceptibility-induced signal decrease. While there has been substantial evidence supporting a role for venous ballooning, there have also been reports arguing for a prolonged post-stimulus elevation in cerebral oxygenation consumption (CMRo(2)) as the primary cause. Furthermore, a contribution of post-stimulus cerebral blood flow (CBF) undershoots has also been demonstrated. To clarify the role of the venous compartment in causing the BOLD undershoot, we performed in vivo fMRI measurements of the transient DeltaCBV(v), DeltaCBF and DeltaBOLD responses in healthy humans. We observed a slow post-stimulus return to baseline in venous CBV which supports the existence of a passive "balloon" effect, implying that previous observations of a quicker recovery of the total CBV response may be dominated by arterial CBV change. Our findings also support a significant contribution from the CBF undershoots, which, combined with a slow venous CBV response, would account for much of the BOLD undershoot.},

abstract = {Changes in glucose consumption, lactate production, and blood oxygenation were measured during prolonged neuronal activation (4-6 min) in human primary visual cortex using dynamic magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging. A decrease of steady-state glucose by 40\% because of enhanced use by 21\% was accompanied by a transient accumulation of lactate with a peak value of 170\% 2.5 min after stimulation onset. Rapid blood hyperoxygenation indicating uncoupling of blood flow and oxidative metabolism was followed by a return to basal levels over 3 min. Thus, initial nonoxidative glucose consumption during functional activation is gradually complemented by a slower adjustment of oxidative phosphorylation that recouples perfusion and oxygen consumption at a new equilibrium.},

abstract = {Functional neuroimaging is most commonly performed using the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) approach, which is sensitive to changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2)). However, the precise mechanism by which neuronal activity elicits a hemodynamic response remains controversial. Here, visual stimulation (14 secs flashing checkerboard) and breath-hold (4 secs exhale+14 secs breath hold) experiments were performed in alternating sequence on healthy volunteers using BOLD, CBV-weighted, and CBF-weighted fMRI. After visual stimulation, the BOLD signal persisted for 33+/-5 secs (n=9) and was biphasic with a negative component (undershoot), whereas CBV and CBF returned to baseline without an undershoot at 20+/-5 and 20+/-3 secs, respectively. After breath hold, the BOLD signal returned to baseline (23+/-7 secs) at the same time (P>0.05) as CBV (21+/-6 secs) and CBF (18+/-3 secs), without a poststimulus undershoot. These data suggest that the BOLD undershoot after visual activation reflects a persistent increase in CMRO(2). These observations support the view that CBV and CBF responses elicited by neuronal activation are not necessarily coupled to local tissue metabolism.},
