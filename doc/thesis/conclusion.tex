This work has proposed and demonstrated the use of a particle filter
for the estimation of BOLD model parameters. Because many of the parameters
were under constrained from the point of view of the BOLD response, a
full posterior estimate was a more logical approach to parameter estimation
than a single point estimate of the parameters. The particle filter also converged
quickly to correct output estimates, and thus provides a framework
for future real-time FMRI experiments. Final BOLD estimates were also comparable
to the results of SPM.
