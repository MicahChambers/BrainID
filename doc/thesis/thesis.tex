{\large BOLD Parameter Estimation Using Particle 
Filters }

\vfill

(ABSTRACT)

\vfill

\end{center}

Traditional methods of analyzing FMRI images use a linear combination of
just a few static regressors. This works demonstrates an alternative
approach using a physiologically inspired nonlinear model. By using a 
particle filter to optimize the model parameters, the computation time
is kept below a minute per voxel without requiring a linearization 
of the noise in the state
variables. The activation results show regions similar those found in 
SPM; however, there are some notable regions not detected by 
SPM. Though the parameters selected by the particle filter based approach
are more than sufficient to predict the BOLD response,
more model constraints are needed to uniquely identify a single set
of parameters. This ill-posed nature explains the large discrepancies
found in other research that attempted to characterize the model parameters.
For this reason the final distribution of parameters is more medically relevant
than a single estimate. Because the output of the particle filter is 
a full posterior probability, the reliance on the mean to estimate 
parameters is not strictly necessary. This work presents
not just a viable alternative to the traditional method of detecting
activation, but an extensible technique of estimating the joint BOLD
parameter distribution.

%stream of new developments in modeling the BOLD signal, nothing has have been
%a plethora of new studies pushing advancements 
%the choice of analysis tools is still relatively limited. Every widely
%available analysis tool is based on parametric modeling, which requires
%prior knowledge of the noise distribution. Indeed, the linear methods
%usually applied are known not to be robust to non-gaussian, non-white
%noise, which is why so many pre-processing steps are necessary.
%These limitations cast a long shadow over any experiment that claims to be
%able to reject the null hypothesis, no matter the P-value. While obviously
%there is a correlation between the BOLD signal and actual activity, its
%possible the current parametric tests are over-estimating the actual amount
%of activity. Its also possible that the current methods underestimate
%actual activity. In this paper we propose a robust model-based approach to 
%activation detection that makes no assumptions about the underlying noise
%model.

%
%The need for concrete examples increases when technology becomes
%difficult to explain.  In documentation for computer systems
%especially, we see a wide audience of field experts attempting to
%comprehend documentation for computer software and hardware of which
%they should only require a cursory understanding.  Additionally, as
%the pace of the information age quickens we see document authors
%struggle for \textit{examplia-concretes} with wide applicability, and
%consistently rely on excerpts from Shakespearean literature as a
%public-domain source for their various explications.
%
%We predict the twenty-first century will be no different.  Actuarial
%studies show explosion in the information industry such that four out
%of five persons will be \textit{bona fide} electronic document
%authors; many of those will have one or more college degrees.  We
%prove through computer simulation \textsc{Machinum Simitatores} that
%authors of twenty-first century literature will be affected by these
%examples and will include metaphor with Shakespearean source into
%their writing with increasing frequency.
