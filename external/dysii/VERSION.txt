1.4.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Decoupled filters and smoothers.
* Added kernel forward-backward and two-filter smoothers
  (KernelForwardBackwardSmoother, KernelTwoFilterSmoother) with optimisations.
* Finished kd tree implementation (KDTree and related classes):
    - Dual-tree and self-tree evaluations (kde.hpp)
    - Median partition function (MedianPartitioner)
    - Redistribution of samples across nodes using kd tree with 
      distributed median partitioner (DiracMixturePdf::redistributeBySpace()).
* Added distributed kernel density estimators (KernelDensityPdf,
  KernelDensityMixturePdf).
* Improved stochastic adaptive Runge-Kutta:
    - Permits use of any numerical scheme in GSL.
    - Improved performance under additive noise using templates.
* Added text file reader and writer (TextFileReader, TextFileWriter).
* Corrected autocorrelator (AutoCorrelator).
* WienerProcess updated to be more convenient for its most common use with
  numerical solvers for SDE.
* Some renaming of classes to standardise terminology.
* Updated build scripts to automatically detect f2c.
* Performance improvements, including more aggressive inlining and less
  dependence on virtuals.
* Minor bug fixes.
* Added installation guide (INSTALL.txt).

Notes:

1. DeterministicParticleResampler has been renamed
   StratifiedParticleResampler.
2. KernelDensityParticleResampler has been renamed
   RegularisedParticleResampler.
3. Smoothers are no longer coupled to a filter. Instead, perform a filter,
   and pass its final result to the constructor of a Smoother object to 
   initialise a method for the backward pass.


1.3.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added stochastic adaptive Runge-Kutta.
* Added density and kernel density (KD) trees.

Notes:

1. The KD tree implementation is preliminary and lacks approximation
   optimisations. These will be added in future releases.


1.2.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added auxiliary particle filter.
* Added generalised resampling strategy framework.
* Fixed diagonal covariance detection for optimised Gaussian density
  calculations.
* Fixed several serialization bugs.
* Fixed Wiener process variance bug.

Notes:

1. ParticleFilter and ParticleSmoother no longer automatically perform
   resampling. Instead, calls to filter() or smooth() should be
   preceeded by calls to resample() or smoothedResample() when
   resampling is desired, passing in an object representing the chosen
   resampling strategy, such as
   indii::ml::filter::DeterministicParticleResampler or
   indii::ml::filter::AuxiliaryParticleResampler.


1.1.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Overhauled parallel implementations from master-slave to SPMD.
* Improved particle smoother with further parallelisation.
* Added distributed storage of mixtures.
* Added Gaussian mixture distributions.
* Added serialization of probability distributions.
* Fixed Wiener process variance bug.

Notes:

1. ParallelParticleFilter and ParallelParticleSmoother have been
   removed. ParticleFilter and ParticleSmoother now have built-in
   parallel support. MPI is now required in order to use particle
   methods, even if only running on a single machine. The rationale
   behind this is to avoid maintenance of both serial and parallel
   versions of the same code.

2. The overhauled particle methods take advantage of the new
   distributed storage for mixtures, so that particles are distributed
   across all nodes rather than stored on one central node as
   before. The parallel implementation of the forward-backward
   particle smoother also now parallelises multiplications involving
   the alpha matrix.

3. SampledPdf has been removed in favour of the new DiracMixturePdf.
