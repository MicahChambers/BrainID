Todo List:
-put particles on the command line
-get mpi working
-Use maybe faster sampling.
-Derive an fmri sequence to optimally extract the bold system parameters, may want to 
 apply maths to the problem.
-Need to add nifti data to boldgen and fmri_timeseries to define time parameters as well
 as some other misc data.
-Normalize timeseries based on the total average, not just for each section.
-Perform tests to compare estimation of parameters using the average from a section
as compared to estimation of parameters for all the voxels in the section, with each
voxel as a state.
