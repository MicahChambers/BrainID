Todo List:
-graph of particle filter converging for a small number of particles
    -save every particle at every time
-graph of nonlinearities, and a linear fit to a nonlinear activation
    -code to generate timeseries with +-10% for each parameter and the hemodynamic response for that
-tests comparing delta/direct/dc
-graph of error and variance decreasing for a correct convergeance and a bad convergeance
    -variance exists
    -node code to save %diff between estimated and real over time
-Do a measure of gaussianity on the particles.
-Look at Most likely instead instead of average
