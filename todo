Todo List:
-Preprocessing
-Generate version.h from subversion/git, then add version information to all nifti files and 
  anything else output.

Potential improvements
-Maybe assumptions should be made about the starting location of the 4
mobile variables. Resting state maybe?

-Maybe try settling out to different levels of stimuli.

-Do a measure of gaussianity on the particles.
-Look at Most likely instead instead of average
