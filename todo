Todo List:
-Make a new particlefilter that allows input.
-convert Dysii to cmake.
-Normalize timeseries based on the total average, not just for each section.
-Perform tests to compare estimation of parameters using the average from a section
as compared to estimation of parameters for all the voxels in the section, with each
voxel as a state.
-Modify transition functions to change state in place, to reduce overhead of returning by
copy. The may only result in a minor performance boost, and would require a rewrite of 
particle filter code. It would also have to be written in such a way that the old particles
could be preserved in cases where we ant to see the time series of the particles
