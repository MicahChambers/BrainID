Todo List:
-Do a measure of gaussianity on the particles.
-Look at Most likely instead instead of average
-graph of particle filter converging for a small number of particles
-graph of nonlinearities, and a linear fit to a nonlinear activation
-tests comparing delta/direct/dc
    -need tool to create a timeseries, add noise and add drift
    -need to compare estimated signal with timeseries before noise/drift
-graph of error and variance decreasing for a correct convergeance and a bad convergeance
