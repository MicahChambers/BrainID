Todo List:
-Modify weights so that measurements of NaN and inf will return 0 weights
-Change SuggestPrior to return a Non-Guassian distribution that doesn't allow for negative
parameters.
-Add randomness (perhaps gaussian noise) to state update. Not sure if the noise should be in
the actual states or the ds/dt, although I think ds/dt would make more sense, so that longer
time intervals result in more randomness.
-Modify transition functions to change state in place, to reduce overhead of returning by
copy. The may only result in a minor performance boost, and would require a rewrite of 
particle filter code. It would also have to be written in such a way that the old particles
could be preserved in cases where we ant to see the time series of the particles
