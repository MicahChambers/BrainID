Todo List:
-Thinner, stimuli
-Look at variances
-Preprocessing
-Use maybe faster sampling.
-Derive an fmri sequence to optimally extract the bold system parameters, may want to 
 apply maths to the problem. See sloppy models.
-Need to add nifti data to boldgen and fmri_timeseries to define time parameters as well
 as some other misc data.
-Normalize timeseries based on the total average, not just for each section.
-Perform tests to compare estimation of parameters using the average from a section
as compared to estimation of parameters for all the voxels in the section, with each
voxel as a state.

for parameters that are "constant" it might be worth looking at the overall
mean squared error over the entire sequence up to the current time 
for weighting. This would be O(N^2)
but we are already at O(PN) and typically P is vastly larger than N.
